FDE Cycle

Fetch
The Memory Address Register would copy the current instruction in the Program Counter to be fetched or stored in main memory, and the data within main memory at that address will be copied to the MDR. The program Counter will incremented by 1.

Decoding
The data in the MDR will be decoded.

Execution

The instruction is executed in the ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT and any results are stored in the ACCUMULATOR.

A hard disk becomes filled with order data.
Over time they would want delete old order data.
This will leave gaps in the hard drive.
When big order data is being downloaded, the data will fragmented across the hard drive.
When the hard drive is reading the order, it will have to make more read access.
Because more read access are required, the read time will increase, therefore the computer's performance decreases.

Utility software: computer software for the operating system that helps maintain the performance of the computer. This includes defragmentation software.


How it works:
It collects free empty sectors and clumps/aggregate them together making one big free space. It collates frequently accessed data like the big order together.


DDOS
Distributed Denial of Service

A zombie network is a collection of infected computer.
A central hacker give them a target like google.com or any ip
These bots on this botnet will send lots bogus fake web traffic.
This large amount of web traffic will cause google's server to overwhelm and crashes.
This causes downtime for google's server therefore operational disruption.


o TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
o HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
o HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)
o FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
o POP (Post Office Protocol)
o IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
o SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)


EMAIL PROTOCOLS
IMAP, POP

POST OFFICE PROTOCOL
One key difference is that POP deletes its copy of the mail from the server once you have downloaded on your computer. IT GETS POPPED FROM THE SERVER.

IMAP 
INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL
OPPOSITE OF POP, the server retains a copy of the mail.

What protocol is this scenario using:

A person visits google.com, HTTPS
A person downloading an email from gmail, SMTP






Standard:
Protocols allow compatibility between devices by using a set of rules.




User Access Levels prevent unauthorised tampering of the system by setting rules for user groups. This restricts access.


Computer misuse act, Data protection act, copyright and patents act

You cannot use without permission, intellectual property of other companies/persons. 

Friend torrents a music file because they didnt want to pay for it


DPA - BUSINESSES
DPA principle- the company must have adequate security to protect customer data




The problem is that artists are not being compensated for their work.






Open Source vs Proprietary software
Open Source is usually free. sometimes not

Open Source allows other programmers to collaborate and develop/improve on your code, OR MAKE THEIR OWN SPIN OFF VERSION 

Proprietary software usually costs money. sometimes not
Individuals will need to buy the specific license for which they will use.



o Sequence
o Selection
o Iteration

If you Iterate through a list, you are going through each element in that list

print("test")
for x in [1,1,1,1,1]:
    print(x)
if (1==1):
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")


file = open("results.txt", "r" )
for line in file:
    print(line)
file.close()


file = open("results.txt", "w")
file.write( "testtesttest\n123456789" )
file.close()





# w  write, OVERWRITE
# a  append, APPEND
# r  read, READ
